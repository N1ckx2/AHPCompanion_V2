 Algonquin Heritage Project Companion Version 2. The Algonquin Expedition is a 4-day research trip involving 60 grade 10 students who analyze the soil and water properties of over 60 sample stations. This numeric and pictorial data is stored in a program known as the Algonquin Heritage Project. This program aids in the formatting and transfer of that data to the program.
 
To Transfer Scans:
1. Ensure the all the paths are correct, especially USB source path. This can be modified right in the text field.
2. Insert USB with scans inside of a folder named "FITx", where x is the FIT number.
3. Ensure the Expedition and Traverse are correct.
4. If all the sample stations for that traverse are in the folder, leave SSi and SSf on "Auto". If not, indicate both the start and final SS in the folder.
5. Click "Move" to move and rename scans.
6. Voila!

To Transfer Images:
1. Ensure the all the paths are correct, especially source path (usually SD card). This can be modified right in the text field.
2. Insert FIT's SD card. 
3. Ensure the Expedition and Traverse are correct.
4. If all the sample stations for that traverse are in the folder, leave SSi and SSf on "Auto". If not, indicate both the start and final SS on the card. This is less important for images, as you can just "cancel" the filechooser if you do not want to select images for that sample station.
5. When you click move, a file chooser will open up. Choose the photos taken for that sample station (indicated in the title of the file chooser). The image preview should help you find the black image so you can distinguish photos from different sample stations.
6. The file chooser will move files as you click enter. After the final one, all the images in that folder will be backed up in storage.
7. Ta-da!
